# Employee Management System

A simple **full-stack CRUD application** built during my internship to learn how **frontend, backend, and database** interact with each other.  
It allows adding, editing, deleting, and viewing employees, with changes reflected in the frontend and database.

---

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Flutter  
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express  
- **Database:** MySQL (local, Workbench)  

---

## Features
- **Employee Management**  
  - View active employees  
  - Add new employees  
  - Edit existing employee details  
  - Soft delete (changes status to inactive instead of removing the row)  
- **Departments**  
  - View employees by department  
- **Navigation**  
  - Home, Employees, Departments, Contact Us pages  

---

## How to Run
- **Clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/khizar-45/EmployeeManagementSystem.git
   ```
- **Set up the backend:**
    ```bash
    cd backend && npm install && node server.js
    ```
- **Run the frontend:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend && flutter pub get && flutter run
    ```

## Learning Outcome
- This project taught me the foundations of full-stack development, including: 

    - Building a UI with Flutter

    - Creating REST APIs with Express

    - Connecting a database with MySQL

    - Understanding Full-Stack Architecture
